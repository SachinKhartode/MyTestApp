1. User make request 
2. UrlRoutingModule receive user request and It decides whether the request would be handled by our MVC application or not.
3. RoutHandler match the requested URL with registered routes in route table.
4. MvcHandler initiate Asp.Net pipeline for MVC application. It receive controller instance from controller factory and handle the further processing
5. ControllerFactory create the controller object in ProcessRequest() method of MvcHandler using constructor with no parameters.
6. After creating controller object, controllerbase class Execute() method called.
7. Execute() calls to ExecuteCore() abstract method and that retrive action name from route data.
8. ExecuteCore() calls ActionInvoker's InvokeAction() method
9. ActionInvoker find the action method name in controller and invoke it.
10. controller action method generate the action result to disply on view for client.
